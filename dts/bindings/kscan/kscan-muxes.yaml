title: KScan Muxes Instance

description: >
  A binding for a KScan instance which is polling hall effect sensors
  by multiplexing either ADC channels or enable pins.
  So the board configuration could be either:
    - Hall effect sensors connected to the MUXes with ADC channels
      and each MUX common pin acts as input for the ADC channel on the MCU.
    - Hall effect sensors connected to the MUXes with enable pins
      and each MUX common pin serves as output for selecting active sensor.
  The second configuration requires 1 more pin on the MCU for the ADC channel (per MUX)
  but it significantly reduces the power consuption, since only one sensor is active at a time (per MUX).
  The more ADC channels (and, of course, corresponding MUXes) you have the more performance you can get
  since you can read another channel while the other one is waiting settle-time.
